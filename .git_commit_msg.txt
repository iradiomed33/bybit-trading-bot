B2: Fix Bybit v5 signature implementation and add comprehensive tests

Key changes:
- Separated sign_request() function with GET vs POST differentiation
- GET: Signs sorted query params (URL-encoded string)
- POST/PUT/DELETE: Signs raw JSON body (compact JSON without spaces)
- Updated _request() to use new signature function correctly
- Fixed bug: POST was previously signing query string instead of body

New tests:
- test_signature.py: 16 tests covering signature generation and validation
- test_private_api.py: 10 tests covering private endpoints and error handling
- All 26 new tests passing

This fixes the "invalid signature" errors that would occur on private API calls.
